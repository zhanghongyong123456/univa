## LLM Object Extraction Task Prompt

**Task Description:**  
You need to extract the objects that need to be tracked from the user’s input sentence. The extracted objects will be provided as a list to Ground DINO for generating bounding box annotations.

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Input Analysis:**  
   - Carefully read and understand the user’s input sentence.  
   - Identify all explicitly described objects in the sentence, paying attention to descriptive words that help uniquely identify objects (such as color, location, size, etc.).

2. **Object Extraction:**  
   - Extract all the objects that need to be tracked from the sentence.  
   - Each object should contain only the necessary descriptive information, excluding irrelevant words (such as conjunctions, prepositions, etc.).

3. **Output Format:**  
   - Return the extracted objects in JSON format.  
   - The JSON should include a key `"objects"`, and its value should be an array where each element is an object name.  
   - If no objects are identified, return an empty array.

**Example Outputs:**

- **Example 1:**  
  **Input:** "Please track the black cat outside the window and the white dog in the yard."  
  **Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "objects": [
      "black cat",
      "white dog"
    ]
  }

- **Example 2:**
  **Input:** "Track the red sports car in the front and the blue motorcycle in the back."  
  **Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "objects": [
      "red sports car",
      "blue motorcycle"
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Important Notes:**
  **If no objects are recognized in the input, return an empty object array in the following format:**
  ```json
  {
    "objects": []
  }
  ```
