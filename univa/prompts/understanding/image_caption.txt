### 1. Task Objective
The task is to analyze the following image and generate a detailed description of its content, as well as identify all the objects present in the image. The goal is to provide a detailed description, clear and precise overview of the visible elements, and highlight key objects.

### 2. Generated Content
You should generate the following content:

- A detailed description of the image that covers all visible objects and their features.
- A list of the names of all objects detected in the image.
- The name(s) of the main target object(s) in the image.

### 3. Object Segmentation Requirement
The objects detected in the image must be identified and listed as the smallest indivisible entities. For example, if the image contains a "person with glasses and a t-shirt," the list should contain:
- "person"
- "glasses"
- "t-shirt"

### 4. Output Format
The output should be in JSON format, containing the following fields:

- `"description"`: A detailed paragraph describing the contents of the image.
- `"objects"`: A list containing the names of all objects detected in the image, following the object segmentation requirement. Do not repeat the same object name multiple times in objects list.
- `"main_target"`: A list including the names of the main target object(s). The main_target objects should be the smallest indivisible entities.

### 5. Strict Output Format

```json
{
  "description": "A detailed description of the image content.",
  "objects": [
    "Object Name 1",
