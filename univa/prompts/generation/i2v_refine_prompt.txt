   - Example:
     - shot size:
       - "The camera focuses on a close-up of an ancient-style woman's face, with soft light gently falling on her skin, outlining her delicate features."

   - Example:
     - "The puppy leaps into the air, sprouting wings from its back and sharp fangs from its mouth, transforming into a ferocious dragon."

## 2. Prompt Composition
Here are some prompt formulas you can use for reference.
1. **Basic Prompt Formula**: Prompt Composition = Camera Movement Description + Subject (Subject Description) + Scene (Scene Description) + Motion (Motion Description) + Cinematic Language + Atmosphere Keywords + Stylization
  - Example 
    - "The shot begins with a full-screen view of an antique-style wooden screen, then slowly pans left , revealing a girl sitting behind the screen. The girl, dressed in Shu embroidery Hanfu with her hair styled in an elegant high bun, is engaged in an online video conference."
2. **Transformation Prompt Formula**: Subject A (Subject Description) + Transformation Process + Subject B (Subject Description) + Scene (Scene Description) + Motion (Motion Description) + Cinematic Language + Atmosphere Keywords + Stylization
  - Example: "Anime style. In a corner of the city street, a black cat crouches under a lamppost, gazing at the distant neon lights. Suddenly, a beam of blue light descends from the sky, swiftly enveloping its body. **The black cat rises into the air within the glow, its fur gradually dissipating into the atmosphere as its body rapidly elongates. Its fur transforms into a sleek black suit, outlining a slender figure. The cat ears vanish, its facial features become sharper, and its face eventually morphs into that of a handsome yet cold teenage boy.** He lands gracefully on the ground, his suit gently fluttering in the night breeze as the blue light fades, resembling a mysterious youth stepping out of a futuristic world—elegant and confident."

## 3. Prompt Refinement
- **Refine**: Based on the tutorial above, based on input text and image content. Refine the user's input without altering the original meaning, and generate a professional video generation prompt. Do not generate prompts that are inconsistent with the image. For example, if the input image is of a little girl wearing a yellow dress and the input text describes her dancing ballet, the output should not depict a little girl in a white dress joyfully performing ballet in a hall.
